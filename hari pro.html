								<p>Kaithi serves as the first instalment in the planned Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU). In June 2022, Lokesh stated that the film was interlinked with the Kamal Haasan-starrer Vikram (2022). Avinash Ramachandran, writing for Cinema Express stated the possibilites of the connection, within the two films, referring to stash of drugs which had scorpion symbol (shown in Vikram's trailer), and in a scene where, Inspector Bejoy (Narain) while speaking to informer Ajhas Ahmed (Kanna Ravi), questions about "The Ghost", Suriya's undisclosed cameo before the film's release and several speculations.[124] Before Vikram's release, Lokesh asked fans to watch Kaithi before Vikram to understand the context of the film,[125] thereby confirming its connection with the two films.[126].</p>
								<p>Narain reprises his role in brief as Inspector Bejoy in Vikram. Additionally, Arjun Das, Harish Uthaman, Hareesh Peradi, Dheena and Baby Monica, reprises their roles in cameo appearances as Anbu, Adaikalam, Stephen Raj, Kamatchi and Amudha, respectively, in the film's mid-credits scene, while Karthi reprised his role in a voice-over.</p>

								<p>2019: In Chennai, John Durairaj J.D is a college lecturer beloved by his students for his student-friendly approach. He is struggling with alcoholism and bitter dislike from fellow staff. Charulatha aka Charu, a newly hired lecturer at his college is the only one who sympathizes with him. After J.D organizes a college election that goes awry, he is assigned to a juvenile detention facility for a 3-month assignment he does not remember volunteering for. J.D reluctantly assumes his new position and is warned by the prison authorities of the rampant drug abuse and violence there, but J.D pays no heed. Sabari and Manikandan are two brothers, who are supposed to surrender for one of Bhavani's murders, slip a note to an unknown J.D, and later that night try to call him while he is drunk. When they are caught, Bhavani kills them and their bodies are discovered hanging from the ceiling of the detention center classroom the next day.</p>
								<p>With J.D incapacitated by grief, Das abducts most of the inmates, intending to take them out of Tamil Nadu along with Bhavani's Benami documents. With the help of his friend and expert archer Vanathi, J.D defeat Das's men and rescues the children. J.D confronts Das and makes him realize Bhavani will kill him because he is the link between Bhavani and the crimes in the detention facility. Das reforms and transports J.D to Bhavani's meatpacking plant along with the children. Das overpowers the men sent to kill him while J.D confronts Bhavani. Although Bhavani gets the upper hand, J.D manages to defeat Bhavani, who later urges J.D to join him in politics, but J.D kills him, thus avenging Sabari and Manikandan's death. With the children safe, J.D and Das surrender to the police. The detention facility is shut down by the government, with the inmates being sent to other detention facilities and state prisons, based on their age. J.D., Das, and the other adults from the facility are sent to prison, where they intend to reform the inmates there.</p>

								<p>Lokesh Kanagaraj was signed by Kamal Haasan's production house Raaj Kamal Films International to direct a film for the studio during November 2019. For which he had previously mentioned his admiration of Kamal Haasan's work, noting that two of the actor's films, Sathya (1988) and Virumaandi (2004), had influenced him to become a film director. Despite agreeing terms, both the director and the studio opted to prioritise commitments, for other films before beginning production work. Lokesh narrated the script of the proposed film to Rajinikanth during December 2019. The project which was tentatively titled as Thalaivar 169, was scheduled to be launched in March 2020. Despite the progress of discussions, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the launch of the film</p>
								<p>After Kamal Haasan's commitments during the 2021 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections, on 7 April, a post was shared by Lokesh Kanagaraj through his social media handles,anticipating that the pre-production works for the film had begun. Since Haasan decided to shoot for the film only after the election results, since he contested in the Coimbatore South constituency, he demanded Lokesh to make changes in the script, however, that was delayed due to the pandemic. Initially, it was planned as a single shooting schedule for 60 days, with a new technology, that would shorten the days of film production, being undisclosed, did not happen as plan. In the film, Kamal Haasan was reported to play a retired police officer and media reports stated that he will don a "khaki uniform" for this film, after 15 years since the Gautham Vasudev Menon-directorial Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006). He was reported to sport a thick beard in the film. For the flashback portions, Lokesh Kanagaraj reported to use de-aging technology for the film. The flashback sequence in its entirety, was eventually said to be cost around ₹10 crore, particularly for the technology used in the film.[43][44] In April 2022, Lokesh had submitted the film's script at the Copyright Office, New Delhi for legal copyrights.</p>
